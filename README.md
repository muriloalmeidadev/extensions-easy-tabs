# Easy Tabs

This is a personal project created to handle multiple tabs from and to clipboard.

For now I'm going to add a few customization behavior thins such as;

- `Consider Current Tab`, which is different behavior than the `close tabs` from firefox, for example.
- `Close after action` for closing or keeping the tabs open after copy/group action.

Requests, issues and whatever you feel saying, please open a request here.
