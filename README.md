# Easy Tabs

This is a personal project created to handle multiple tabs urls from and to clipboard and stuff.

I'm not going to do much here other than a few customization things such as below, the idea of the extension is to be as simple as possible.

- `Consider Current Tab`, which is different behavior than the `close tabs` from firefox, for example.
- `Close after action` for closing or keeping the tabs open after copy/group action.

Requests, issues and whatever you feel saying, please open a request here.
